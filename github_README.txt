This repository contains two files for fitting and running latent class
and time-to-event distal outcome models. The first file contains all of
the functions and sub-functions required to fit the models.

github_lcsm_functions_v40.R

The second file contains R code showing a simple of example of a local
independence model with 3 manifest variables (two categorical, one
continuous). The data set prostate.csv first needs to be downloaded 
(see instructions in file) and the location of the functions and data
set need to be set before the file will work.
